          <p>
            When I set out to pursue <strong>orthopaedics</strong>, I quickly realized just how little time is devoted to it during medical training. Like many others, I faced a <strong>steep learning curve</strong> and found myself struggling to efficiently absorb the foundational knowledge I needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The sheer number of <strong>classification systems</strong>, treatment principles, and surgical decision-making frameworks felt overwhelming. I often wished there were a more efficient, structured way to approach this learning — a tool that could help me quickly grasp and retain these concepts.
          </p>

          <p>
            That frustration sparked the idea for SnapOrtho: a resource designed to make learning orthopaedics <strong>faster, clearer, and more practical</strong> — so that future learners wouldn’t have to start from scratch the hard way.
